# AIPLAYER

Basically, this is a Google Home Action that plays MP3 files from your own web space.

Google Home (using Google Play) does not remember where I stopped listening to start over at this position next time.
It always start at the beginning, bad on audio books.

So I wrote this Google Home Action (Alexa call it Skill) with some memory inside.

This is Proof of Concept code, no final project! (But is works, basically)
